 ---PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 1---

 ---For this project we were tasked to create a simple 2D Top-Down Game similar to something from the Bomberman series. The project was completed using Unity software---

 ---The requirements for this project was to implement the following features: movement, asstes, colliding, scores, lives, power-ups, speed change and a game over screen---

---To be able to run the project you must make sure you have aquired the proper Unity file from the Github repo. This Unity file has all the assets from the game and includes all the scripts that allow the game to work. Once you have the Unity file you must open the Unity project scene and then click the play button at the top of the screen. That will start the game. 

---To see the full project in affect, try and collect the power-up and watch as you speed up. Crashing into obstacles will result in lowering your total lives and eventually if you reach zero a game over screen will appear. That is also the only way the game will actually end unless you click the play buttin again on Unity.
